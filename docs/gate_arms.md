# Gate Arms

Select `View ‚ûî Gate Arm` menu item

Gate arms are traffic control devices which restrict access to a section of
roadway.  They are commonly used for on-ramps or reversible lanes.

## Setup

The gate arm properties form has setup information.

Field             | Description
------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes             | administrator notes, possibly including [hashtag]s to be referenced in [device action]s
Preset            | verification [camera] preset
Opposing          | enable check for gates on this road in another direction
Downstream (#tag) | [hashtag] for downstream gates which must open prior to this

The verification [camera] preset can be used to check oncoming traffic
before operating gates.

An [action plan] is required for each gate arm group to be controlled.  It
must have three [phase]s:
- `ga_open`: gates open and optional [DMS] displaying "open" message
- `ga_change`: gates open, with DMS displaying "closed"
- `ga_closed`: gates closed and optional DMS displaying "closed"

[Device action]s must be assigned to these phases to control devices:
- Gate arm hashtags should be assigned to `ga_open` and `ga_change`, but not
  `ga_close`.
- Different DMS messages can be displayed for each phase, as necessary.

## States and Interlocks

Gate arms are continuously monitored, and can be in one of these states:

State        | Description             | Possibly Open | Possibly Closed
-------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------
`OPENING`    | opening in progress     | ‚òëÔ∏è             | ‚òëÔ∏è
`OPEN`       | gate open               | ‚òëÔ∏è             |
`CLOSING`    | closing in progress     | ‚òëÔ∏è             | ‚òëÔ∏è
`CLOSED`     | gate closed             |               | ‚òëÔ∏è
`FAULT`      | fault in gate operation | ‚òëÔ∏è             | ‚òëÔ∏è
`UNKNOWN`    | no commnuication        | ‚òëÔ∏è             | ‚òëÔ∏è

If communication is lost to a gate arm for longer than the value of
`gate_arm_alert_timeout_secs` [system attribute], its state will be set to
`UNKNOWN`.

An **interlock** can prevent dangerous traffic conflicts:
- **Deny Open** prevents opening, triggered by opposing gates _possibly_ open
  or downstream gates _possibly_ closed.
- **Deny Close** prevents closing, triggered by upstream gates _possibly_ open.
- **Deny All** prevents opening or closing (both conditions above).
- **System Disable** prevents operating any gates (see below).

If a constraint is broken, IRIS will never automatically try to resolve it.
Instead, an _alert_ will logged in the `email_event` table.

## Control

On the gate arm tab, up to two DMS associated with the selected plan are
displayed, with current messages.  Also, video from one or two verification
cameras is shown.  The _swap_ button can switch between larger and smaller
views.

Below that, up to 6 associated gate arms are listed, with the current arm
state and interlocks for each.

There are three buttons to control the plan, which are enabled dependeing
on the current [phase].  When an operator presses a button, its corresponding
phase will be requested:
- `Open` ‚áí `ga_open`
- `Change` ‚áí `ga_change` ‚Ä†
- `Close` ‚áí `ga_closed`

‚Ä† `Change` is only enabled if a [device action] is configured with the
`ga_change` phase.  Operators can use this to warn motorists when the gates
will soon be changed.

## Security

There are a couple of extra security features to restrict access to gate arm
control.

### Allowlist

There is a list of IP addresses from which clients are allowed to control a
gate arm action plan.  It is specified as the `gate.arm.allowlist` property in
the `/etc/iris/iris-server.properties` configuration file.  The property
contains a list of addresses in [CIDR] notation (exact IP, or ranges specified
such as `192.168.1.0/24`).

### System Disable

Another security feature causes the entire _gate arm system_ to be disabled
whenever a configuration change is made.  This includes any changes to a gate
arm, [controller], associated [comm link] or [action plan].  IRIS will not
send any command to open or close any gate arm while in this state.  The only
way to re-enable gate arm control is to create a file in the server filesystem
at `/var/lib/iris/gate_arm_enable` (using the touch command).
